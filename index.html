        <p class = 'theory'>A rectangle is a 2-dimensional shape/polygon with four sides, four vertices, and four right angles. 
            The two opposite sides in the rectangle are equal and parallel to each other. 
            The area of a rectangle is the space covered by the shape and can be computed by 
            knowing the 2 dimensions, width and length, measured in meters (m).
            The unit of measure of area is &#13217.</p>

            <p class="calcu_par">Below you can compute the area of your rectangle.
                You should keep in mind that the width and length must be
                positive numbers.
