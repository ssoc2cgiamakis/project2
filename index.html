        <h1>Calculation of area of a rectangle</h1>
        <p class = 'theory'>A rectangle is a 2-dimensional shape/polygon with four sides, four vertices, and four right angles. 
            The two opposite sides in the rectangle are equal and parallel to each other. 
            The area of a rectangle is the space covered by the shape and can be computed by 
            knowing the 2 dimensions, width and height, measured in meters (m).
            The unit of measure of area is &#13217.</p>
        <div class = 'calculation'>
            <p>Below you can compute the area of your rectangle.
                You should keep in mind that the width and height must be
                positive numbers.
            </p>
            <h5>Enter the width and height of the rectangle</h1>
            <h6>Width (m) : <input type ="number" id ="width"></h2>
            <h6>Height (m): <input type ="number" id ="height"></h2>
